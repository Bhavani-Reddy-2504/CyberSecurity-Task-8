
Task 8 – SQL Injection Analysis

The OWASP Juice Shop application was tested for SQL Injection vulnerabilities
using the SQLMap tool.

The search parameter "q" was identified from the application URL and selected
for testing. SQLMap was used to analyze this parameter using automated testing
methods.

Initial SQL Injection tests were performed successfully, and SQLMap executed
multiple checks to determine parameter behavior. Database enumeration,
table listing, and user data extraction were attempted using SQLMap commands.

The application did not allow successful database or table enumeration.
This behavior indicates the presence of input validation, error handling,
and defensive mechanisms that limit automated SQL Injection exploitation.

Although data extraction was not successful, the testing process itself was
completed correctly and provided valuable insight into SQL Injection testing
and application security defenses.
